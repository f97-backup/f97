Experience
----------


_[6/2021 - current]_ - **Blue Otter Corporation**


Projects have joined or built alone: 

* [Operativeunderground](https://www.operativeunderground.com/) a project uses React.js and Firebase as backend, React.js uses redux for state management. Built from scratch, and made by only me to probation.
* [Feastin](https://feastin.com/) a project connecting restaurant with customers, participating as a team member, mainly edit interface and css to client opinions.
* [cloudcath](https://www.cloudcath.com/) build software for client, a fairly large project and divided into several phases, mainly fixing bugs for client for security reasons.
* some other internal projects (React.js or React Native), manage servers for companies and customers because they have not yet recruited devops.

_[2/2019 - 6/2020]_ - **Co-WELL**

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project: 

:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming LanguagesCancel changes
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
